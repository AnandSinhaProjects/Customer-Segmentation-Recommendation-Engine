# Customer-Segmentation-Recommendation-Engine

This project analyzes a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retailer (available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)) to improve marketing strategies and sales through customer segmentation. We'll transform the data, create customer-focused features, and use K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups. The goal is to develop a recommendation system that suggests top-selling items within each segment, driving better-targeted marketing and increased sales.

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for effective clustering.

    
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation.

    
- **Data Preprocessing**: Undertake feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.

    
- **Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

    
- **Cluster Analysis & Evaluation**: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.

    
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a system to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to boost sales and marketing effectiveness.
